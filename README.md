 #1 Project Overview
 In this project, we design and implement a database schema for a gamified and personalized educational platform. 
 The goal is to support a dynamic and adaptable learning environment that personalizes
 content delivery and interactions based on learners’ unique characteristics, such as personality, emotional state,
 physical and mental health, and background. The platform also aims to enhance engagement
 through gamification elements like badges, quests, and leaderboards.
 The platform’s core focus is to provide a scientifically grounded and pedagogically sound learning experience,
 aligning with the principles of adaptive learning and character computing. By combining learning
 theory with data-driven personalization, the database will act as the backbone, managing learners’ data,
 course content, learning interactions, and gamification features, while enabling fine-grained analytics and
 data tracking
